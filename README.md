Here's a **README.md** file for your **Decentralized Payroll System**:

# **💰 Decentralized Payroll System** 🚀  

## **📌 Overview**  
The **Decentralized Payroll System** is a **blockchain-based salary management solution** that ensures **secure, automated, and trustless** payroll distribution. Employers can manage employee salaries transparently using **Ethereum smart contracts**, **vesting schedules**, and **multi-signature approvals** to prevent unauthorized payments.  

---

## **📌 Features**  
✅ **Automated Payroll** – Employees get paid without manual intervention.  
✅ **Multi-Signature Approvals** – Ensures payments are **verified by multiple parties**.  
✅ **Vesting & Locking** – Salaries **unlock gradually** over time.  
✅ **Supports Stablecoins (USDC, DAI, etc.)** – Avoid crypto volatility.  
✅ **Fully On-Chain & Transparent** – Payroll records stored securely on the blockchain.  
✅ **Smart Contract-Based Security** – Eliminates fraud & salary disputes.  

---

## **📌 How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **Employer Adds Employees** → Define salary, vesting duration, and payment token.  
2️⃣ **Payroll Funding** → Employers deposit salary funds into the smart contract.  
3️⃣ **Multi-Sig Approval** → Payments require **sign-offs from multiple authorized parties**.  
4️⃣ **Automated Salary Payouts** → Employees receive payments **on-chain, in real-time**.  
5️⃣ **Smart Contract Enforcement** → Vesting ensures funds are locked and **released gradually**.  

---

## **📌 Technologies Used**  
🔹 **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (Ethereum, Polygon)  
🔹 **Blockchain Interaction:** Ethers.js / Web3.js  
🔹 **Development Tools:** Hardhat, Remix IDE  
🔹 **Frontend (Optional):** React.js, Next.js  
🔹 **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask / WalletConnect  
🔹 **Test Networks:** Ethereum Goerli / Sepolia  

---

## **📌 Deployment Guide**  
### **1️⃣ Deploy Using Remix IDE**  
1. Open [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).  
2. Create `Payroll.sol` and paste the smart contract code.  
3. Compile the contract (`Solidity 0.8.x`).  
4. Deploy using **Injected Web3 (MetaMask)** → Select **Ethereum Testnet (Goerli/Sepolia)**.  
5. Copy the deployed **contract address** for future transactions.  

### **2️⃣ Fund the Payroll Contract**  
- Call `fundPayroll(amount)`, **transferring USDC/DAI to the contract**.  
- Ensure the sender has **approved** the contract to spend their USDC.  

### **3️⃣ Add Employees**  
```solidity
addEmployee(0xEmployeeWallet, 1000000, 31536000);
```
- `_salary`: `1000000` (1 USDC if using 6 decimals)  
- `_vestingDuration`: `31536000` (1 Year)  

### **4️⃣ Process Payroll Payments**  
```solidity
paySalary(0xEmployeeWallet);
```
- Payments are released **gradually** based on vesting schedule.

## **📌 Smart Contract Functions**  
| Function        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `addEmployee(address _wallet, uint256 _salary, uint256 _vestingDuration)` | Adds a new employee to the payroll system. |
| `fundPayroll(uint256 _amount)` | Employer deposits funds into the payroll contract. |
| `paySalary(address _employee)` | Employees receive vested salaries based on the defined schedule. |
| `contractBalance()` | Retrieves the total balance of the payroll contract. |
